# Derivative-Calculator
This is the current version of my progress in making a fully operational derivative calculator.
As of right now, this is the first upload, thus first version of said calculator. Currently, it can deal with specific polynomial functions where each term is seperated with a plus sign; e.g 2x + 4x^(-5). It does not yet work with a subtraction sign seperation or a combination of both; e.g 2x + 4x^(-5) - 3x^6. Furthermore, the program can only deal with coefficients and exponents, as seen in the two examples. Due to this, the first upload is rather limited, however this is my first ever upload so please do not crticise it too harshly. Eventually, the plan is for it to work with all kinds of functions but that may not be for a long time, as I am an inexperienced coder as of right now. Thank you, and I hope you enjoy it as much as you can.
